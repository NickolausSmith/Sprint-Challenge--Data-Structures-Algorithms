c) O(n)

II) egg function
    x = 1

    while n - x != 1:
        x + 1
        if n - x = 1:
        break
        return x

        then we know how many floors we have by returning x
        throw egg at 1, if egg doesn't break, throw egg at next floor
        once egg breaks return the floor were on
